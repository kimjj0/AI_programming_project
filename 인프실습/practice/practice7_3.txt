The hyperledger is a distributed industry ledger standardization project for the blockchain open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation and aims to implement blockchain technologies applicable to various industries. Hyperledger Fabric is one of Hyperledger’s subprojects, a consortium blockchain. Therefore only authorized participants can access the blockchain network. Hyperledger Fabric generates smart contracts using transactions controlled by chaincode. Through this transaction it is possible to interact with the shared ledger and using the channel function it is possible to share the ledger among the desired members of the network participants. Zcash is a cryptocurrency that completely protects an individual’s transaction information on the public blockchain. Because of applying a protocol using ZeroKnowledgeProof technology, it differs significantly from the existing public blockchain in which anyone can check the transaction details in terms of information disclosure. Therefore, the validity of the transaction can be verified without exposing the receiver, sender, transaction amount, etc. in the Zcash transaction.
